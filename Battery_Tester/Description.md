A circuit that can test voltage of a battery
2 wires, one positive, one negative, can be lined with the corresponding parts of a battery less than 5 volts
If the voltage is greater than or equal to 1.6 volts, the green light will be turned on 
If the voltage is greater than or equal to 1.4 volts, and less than or equal to 1.4 volts, the green yellow will be turned on 
If the voltage is less than 1.4 volts, the red light will be turned on
